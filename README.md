# OverTheWire Writeup Summaries

This repository contains my personal, non-spoiler summaries of the OverTheWire wargames.  
The purpose of this project is to document the concepts, problem-solving approaches, and tools I learned while progressing through each challenge.  
No passwords, flags, or solutions are included. All content complies with OverTheWire rules.

Each wargame focuses on a different area of security, including Linux fundamentals, web security, cryptography, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, memory corruption, and network analysis.  
These writeups serve as a record of my learning and demonstrate my understanding of the concepts involved.

## Goals

The goals of this repository are:

- To reinforce and document the knowledge gained from each wargame  
- To build a public record of continuous learning in cybersecurity  
- To demonstrate familiarity with command-line tools, debugging, exploitation concepts, cryptography, and network behavior  
- To maintain a responsible, rule-compliant portfolio for professional and educational use

## Compliance and Ethics

This repository follows all OverTheWire rules:

- No credentials or level passwords are included  
- No direct solutions or step-by-step instructions are provided  
- Only high-level summaries, concepts, tools, and reasoning are described  

The material is for learning and documentation purposes only. OverTheWire can be found on their [official website](https://overthewire.org/) for those who wish to attempt the challenges themselves.

## Notes

This repository is continuously updated as I progress through the wargames.  
All files are written manually and are intentionally brief, focused summaries rather than detailed walkthroughs.
