# OverTheWire Writeup Summaries

This repository contains my personal, non-spoiler summaries of the OverTheWire wargames.  
The purpose of this project is to document the concepts, problem-solving approaches, and tools I learned while progressing through each challenge.  
No passwords, flags, or solutions are included. All content complies with OverTheWire rules.

Each wargame focuses on a different area of security, including Linux fundamentals, web security, cryptography, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, memory corruption, and network analysis.  
These writeups serve as a record of my learning and demonstrate my understanding of the concepts involved.

## Structure

Each wargame has its own directory. Inside each directory:

- A README describing the scope and theme of the wargame  
- A series of files named levelXX.md containing concept summaries for each level  
- No spoilers, passwords, or walkthroughs

## Wargames Covered

- **Bandit** – Learn Linux fundamentals, file permissions, and command-line tools.  
- **Natas** – Explore web security basics and common web vulnerabilities.  
- **Leviathan** – Practice simple reverse engineering and privilege escalation.  
- **Krypton** – Solve cryptography challenges using classical ciphers and analysis.  
- **Narnia** – Introduction to binary exploitation and memory safety concepts.  
- **Behemoth** – Intermediate binary exploitation and debugging challenges.  
- **Utumno** – Advanced binary exploitation and heap/memory manipulation.  
- **Maze** – Complex reverse engineering and program flow analysis challenges.  
- **Vortex** – Networking-focused exploitation and memory vulnerability exercises.  
- **Manpage** – Learn Linux command-line tools through man page puzzles.  
- **Drifter** – Network traffic analysis and protocol interpretation challenges.  
- **FormulaOne** – Advanced problem-solving and logic-based cybersecurity puzzles.

## Goals

The goals of this repository are:

1. To reinforce and document the knowledge gained from each wargame  
2. To build a public record of continuous learning in cybersecurity  
3. To demonstrate familiarity with command-line tools, debugging, exploitation concepts, cryptography, and network behavior  
4. To maintain a responsible, rule-compliant portfolio for professional and educational use

## Compliance and Ethics

This repository follows all OverTheWire rules:

- No credentials or level passwords are included  
- No direct solutions or step-by-step instructions are provided  
- Only high-level summaries, concepts, tools, and reasoning are described  
- The material is for learning and documentation purposes only

OverTheWire can be found on their official website for those who wish to attempt the challenges themselves.

## Notes

This repository is continuously updated as I progress through the wargames.  
All files are written manually and are intentionally brief, focused summaries rather than detailed walkthroughs.
