## Steps
1. Opened the level page in the browser.
2. Viewed the HTML page source and noticed nothing unusual except for comment `No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time...`.
3. The comment hinted that Google cant find it. So checked the `robots.txt` and found a hidden folder `/s3cr3t`.
4. Navigated to hidden folder and found `users.txt` which contained the password.
