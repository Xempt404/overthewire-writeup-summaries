# Bandit

This folder contains learning summaries for the Bandit wargame from OverTheWire. The purpose is to document concepts, approaches, tools, and techniques explored while completing the challenges. All writeups are **non-spoiler**: no passwords or direct solutions are included.

Each `levelXX.md` file provides a summary of the lessons learned in that level, including the commands used and high-level steps taken.
